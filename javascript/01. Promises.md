## 1. What are promises?
  Promise is object representing the eventual completion or failure of async operation.
  - Promises can have 3 states. pending -> fulfilled | rejected
  - Promises are eagar, not lazy. It starts execution as soon as it is called.

## 2. What is Promise Chaining?
  Promise chaining is a way is handle success and failure in a promise.

```js
  fetch('api.samplejson.com/get')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.err(err))
  .finally(() => console.log("Promise Hanlded"))
```

  - If the promise succedes, we enter the then block. 
  - We can chain promises by returning another promise in a then block.
  - We can handle all the error in a catch block.
  - After all the then and catch blocks, the finally block is executed.
  - When an error occurs in the first then block, the second then block is not executed.

## 3. How to handle errors?

## 4. What are the differences between allSettled, all, any and race?
Several combinators can be used to handle multiple Promises at once.
1. Promise.allSettled: waits for all the promises to be finished

2. Promise.all: needs all the promises to be resolved

3. Promise.any: first one resolved wins

4: Promise.race: first promise wins. resolved or rejected.
